# GBM Option Pricing Simulation
## Overview
This project implements a Geometric Brownian model to simulate stock prices and uses Monte Carlo Method to price European options. Additionally, it includes a Black-Scholes analytical solution for comparison.

## Features
- Simulate stock price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion
- Price European call and put options using Monte Carlo simulation
- Compare Monte Carlo results to the Black-Scholes formula
- Visualization of multiple simulated stock paths

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thdnder/gbm_option_pricing.git
cd gbm_option_pricing
pip install numpy norm matplotlib.pyplot
